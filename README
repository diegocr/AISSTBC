Author:       Diego Casorran <diegocr@users.sf.net>
Type:         gfx/misc

AISSTBC (AISS ToolBar Creator) is a single tool to create toolbar images 
very quickly by just using drag-and-drop MUI feature, such toolbars which 
usefull for developers using Toolbar.mcc or TheBar.mcc into his applications.

Why I've created this tool and why it is called "AISS" comes from when I've 
downloaded the great Mason's AISS package ( available from the followinhg url
http://www.masonicons.info/aiss/index.html ), when I download the package I 
thought it was as well a tool to create toolbars, and get a bit disappointed
when i've not found such a tool, ...then I asked to myself: "why isnt there a
program to create toolbars quickly and on a nice way?" ... at least afaik 
there is no such a tool when it will be indeed a lot helpful, instead using 
paint or similar programs for this job... hence, I decided to write such tool 
myself, hoping it will be usefull to you as it is for me :-)

The usage of the program should be very intuitive for everyone who is 
developing a MUI prog.  The images are loaded via datatypes and the final 
toolbar(s set) saved as well using dt. On the settings window you'll find 
options about how the images are previewed, loaded and saved.  You can also
save the current project (essential feature!) which makes updating a toolbar
even more quickly.

   - Version 0.2
   
   - Fixed a bug which caused the application window to auto-close by loading
     images with different sizes (width/height/depth). Preview images will now
     be loaded by checking its sizes first, which makes the loading time 
     longer unfortunately.. if you're sure your TBImages: folder contains all
     images with matching dimensions you could use the enviroment variable
     AISSTBC_OMITPICD (with a number other than 0) to skip that check.
   
   - Added three new options to the prefs, but for testing purposes as they
     aren't probably helpfull at all...
